TODOs in code

make ControlPanel class? (everything is an object??)

mimic -> copy. toggles on deafen but not on undeafen. that way we can still hear dem music bots :yeah:

maybe DO remember members and their states?
    so we can still unmute members who left muted

control panel:
    format:
        move (STATE) to after display_name
        show all "unlisted" and "gone but muted so listed" with a different left-padding? or show them at the bottom?
    fuzzy username killing/ignoring
    multiple numbers (space-separated) in same message

issues:
    ignored members can cause problems when unmuting
    unignoring -> sets to muted if muted before?

untrack/unmute tracked people everytime a new vc is set # does this already happen?
    new method reset()?

once tracked, only mute inside of channel and unmute elsewhere # tis gon be real slow

setting up:
    append command output/responses to the top of control_panel (chronological still lol) instead of responding. also, delete command messages
    maybe resend the control panel after every message or something idk make the control panel stay at the bottom ughgh

support mutliple guilds:
    among:help

commands for all reactions (maybe not):
    among:mute/among:unmute and the like
    maybe a new Action class that sets up reaction listening, default reaction sending (the reaction sent by the bot to the control panel) and respective commands

voice presence:
    new reaction: joins the voice channel
    when on the vc, plays sounds before muting and after unmuting everyone

reaction: admin-takeover
    AKA among:takeover
    only act when admin reacts/sends commands
    needs a prepared admin role set up with among:admin_role (actually maybe the API provides a way to see if the user is admin)

on release:
    document all documentable things with docstrings or whatever they're called
    add agplv3 license
    add a way to get to the source code (through a command? through among:help?)
    in usage instructions:
        1. create channel for bot
        2. invite bot
        this to avoid people setting the bot in a general chat channel

low priority:
    on startup clear all invalid reactions on old control panel
