TODOs in code

mimic -> copy. toggles on deafen but not on undeafen

in usage instructions:
1. create channel for bot
2. invite bot
this to avoid people setting the bot in a general chat channel

among:setup doesn't work when only switching text channels

once tracked, only mute inside of channel and unmute elsewhere # tis gon be real slow

document all documentable things with docstrings or whatever they're called

fuzzy username killing/ignoring
multiple numbers (space-separated) in same message

untrack/unmute tracked people everytime a new vc is set
    new method reset()?

combine all messages that come into one, and delete it once required actions are completed
    (?)append command output/responses to the top of control_panel (chronological still lol) instead of responding. also, delete command messages

support mutliple guilds:
    among:vc/chat/excluderole should accept optional parameter (actually, might not be possible with among:vc)
    among:unexcluderole to unexclude
    among:help

commands for all reactions (maybe not):
    among:mute/among:unmute and the like
    maybe a new Action class that sets up reaction listening, default reaction sending (the reaction sent by the bot to the control panel) and respective commands

reaction: join
    joins the voice channel
    when joined, plays sounds before muting and after unmuting everyone

reaction: admin-only
    only act when admin reacts
    needs a prepared admin role set up with among:admin_role
    maybe can be easier set up if channel is only visible to admin (+bot ofc)

add agplv3 license

low priority: clear all invalid reactions on startup
