TODOs in code

last filter() -> list comprehension

once tracked, only mute inside of channel and unmute elsewhere

use sets instead of lists where an improvement can be seen

message user personally if can't send to channel

untrack/unmute everyone everytime a new vc is set

combine all messages that come into one, and delete it once required actions are completed
    append command output/responses to the top of control_panel (chronological still lol) instead of responding. also, delete command messages

support mutliple guilds:
    among:vc/chat/excluderole should accept optional parameter (actually, might not be possible with among:vc)
    among:unexcluderole to unexclude

commands for all reactions (maybe not):
    among:mute/among:unmute and the like
    maybe a new Action class that sets up reaction listening, default reaction sending (the reaction sent by the bot to the control panel) and respective commands

reaction: join
    joins the voice channel
    when joined, plays sounds before muting and after unmuting everyone

reaction: admin-only
    only act when admin reacts
    needs a prepared admin role set up with among:admin_role

reaction: request unmute
    requests unmute for user
    unmutes if in another voice channel
    works for everyone even if bot is in admin-only (as long as they're managed by bot)
