bug: didn't update when setting someone to dead

TODOs in code

mimic shouldn't call set_mute or set_mute shouldn't edit ALL members (only the necessary)

support mutliple guilds:
    among:vc   - lists voice channels with index and listens for an index response. configures the vc for the guild
    among:chat - establishes the text channel the command was sent in as the bot channel
    among:setup - alias for among:chat
    among:role - lists roles with index and sets which ones to exclude by index (similar to DEAD menu)
        maybe a new Menu functionality/class

commands for all reactions:
    among:mute/among:unmute and the like
    maybe a new Action class that sets up reaction listening, default reaction sending (the reaction sent by the bot to the control panel) and respective commands

reaction: join
    joins the voice channel
    when joined, plays sounds before muting and after unmuting everyone

reaction: admin-only
    only act when admin reacts

reaction: request unmute
    requests unmute for user
    unmutes if in another voice channel
    works for everyone even if bot is in admin-only (as long as they're managed by bot)

when everyone leaves vc:
    unmute all managed members
    forget all tracked members

# still thinking about this
rename set_mute() to toggle_mute()
    create new update_mute() to replicate old set_mute(True)

take out update_control_panel() from set_mute(). manually call it after calling set_mute()
