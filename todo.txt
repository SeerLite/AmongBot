TODOs in code

Tracked_member -> TrackedMember

reaction: join
    joins the voice channel
    when joined, plays sounds before muting and after unmuting everyone

when everyone leaves vc:
    unmute all managed members
    forget all tracked members

# still thinking about this
rename set_mute() to toggle_mute()
    create new update_mute() to replicate old set_mute(True)

take out update_control_panel() from set_mute(). manually call it after calling set_mute()
