TODOs in code

once tracked, only mute inside of channel and unmute elsewhere

message user personally if can't send to channel

untrack/unmute everyone everytime a new vc is set

combine all messages that come into one, and delete it once required actions are completed

support mutliple guilds:
    among:vc/chat/excluderole should accept optional parameter
    among:unexcluderole to unexclude

commands for all reactions (maybe not):
    among:mute/among:unmute and the like
    maybe a new Action class that sets up reaction listening, default reaction sending (the reaction sent by the bot to the control panel) and respective commands

reaction: join
    joins the voice channel
    when joined, plays sounds before muting and after unmuting everyone

reaction: admin-only
    only act when admin reacts
    needs a prepared admin role set up with among:admin_role

reaction: request unmute
    requests unmute for user
    unmutes if in another voice channel
    works for everyone even if bot is in admin-only (as long as they're managed by bot)
